Exercise - Copy a file

Weâ€™re going to make a small program that takes text from one file
and writes it to a new file. We will let the user decide which file
to take the text from and what to name the new file. Then our program
will create the new file, write the text in the new file, and save
it as the name the user provided. The program will run in the terminal.
